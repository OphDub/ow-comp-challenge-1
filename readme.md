# Static Comp Challenge 1

This static comp challenge required creating a website that followed the basic layout as seen in the Original Comp Example image. Liberties were granted with the copy, images, icons, and color palette (provided it was complementary). Other basic requirements are listed in the Base Requirements section. 

## Base Requirements

*Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css

*Site must be responsive (viewable on a mobile device or desktop)

*Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: [initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. “bt-comp-challenge-1”)

*Include a README with the repo providing brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.

*Push final work to github pages
